\title{Fit a linkage model (screening model + a stacked ensemble}
\usage{
fit_link(
  train,
  formula,
  ensemble = default_ensemble(),
  bounds = c(0.001, 0.999)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{train}{data.frame containing the training data}

\item{formula}{formula. The formula to fit}

\item{ensemble}{a named list of parsnip model specifications}

\item{bounds}{numeric. Two numbers (0-1) representing the predicted probability bounds from the screening model that should be fit with the ensemble.
Results outside these bounds are considered clear enough (not-)matches to not need further processing.}
