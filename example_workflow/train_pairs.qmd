## Creating (new) training data

Unlike probabilistic methods (e.g. splink), machine learning methods require training data to operate. When beginning a new project, a few options are available:

1.  Borrow from a previously fit ML model
2.  Borrow from a probabilistic model
3.  Use some deterministic rules to generate matches/non-matches
4.  Randomly sampled manually labeled pairs

Regardless of the approach, the goal is to have enough pairs to fit a draft model. The draft model can then be used to generate match scores that can inform the selection of additional pairs for manual labeling.
