# About

This repository (and its parent, the `hyrule` package) contains code,
instructions, and commentary on record linkage (also known as entity
resolution) using ensemble machine learning implemented in R.

There are three main vignettes/examples:

1.  [Record Linkage Pipeline](_targets.md): A mostly comprehensive
    example of a `targets` analysis pipeline for machine learning record
    linkage. The [origin \_targets.qmd](_targets.qmd) file uses
    targets-flavored markdown and can be edited (or stripped for parts)
    into a record linkage pipeline using “real” data.
2.  Musings on evaluating results: Opinions and ideas on how to tell if
    a record linkage is any good
3.  Generating new training data: A description of some ways to generate
    effective training data.
