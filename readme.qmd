The `hyrule` package contains functions to facilitate record linkage (i.e., entity resolution) using machine learning. In the example_workflow subdirectory, there is a fully worked out linkage pipeline that demonstrates how `hyrule`, along with a few other packages, can be combined/used to conduct record linkage.

There are three main vignettes/examples:

1.  [Record Linkage Pipeline](example_workflow/_targets.md): A mostly comprehensive example of a `targets` analysis pipeline for machine learning record linkage. The [\_targets.qmd](_targets.qmd) file uses targets-flavored markdown and can be edited (or stripped for parts) into a record linkage pipeline using "real" data. To "recreate" the document users must first render the .qmd file, execute the pipeline via `tar_make()`, and re-render the .qmd file. The double render is required to populate the parts of the document that rely on completed results.
2.  [Evaluating results](example_workflow/eval_link_res.md): Opinions and ideas on how to tell if a record linkage is any good
3.  [Generating new training data](example_workflow/train_pairs.md): A description of some ways to generate effective training data, including a review of the `hyrule::matchmaker()` function/shiny app.
